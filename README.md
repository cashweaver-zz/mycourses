# MyCourses

A self-hosted online learning platform written in node.

## Lessons Learned

This project was built over three days in the pursuit of improving my understanding of software development, APIs (specifically RESTful), TDD/BDD, and tying a bunch of components together into a full stack application. I feel I've been successful. I reimplemented a few wheels and gained a better and lower level understanding of how those wheels are built, and why they are built the way they are.
